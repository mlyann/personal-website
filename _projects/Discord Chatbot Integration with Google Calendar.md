This project orchestrates seamless communication between Discord and Google Calendar, enabling users to manage events directly from their Discord server. Leveraging the capabilities of ChatGPT and Google Calendar APIs, this integration streamlines event creation, retrieval, and interaction, enhancing user experience and productivity.

    Real-time Event Management: Users can create, retrieve, and interact with events in real-time 
    through simple Discord commands.

    Natural Language Processing: Utilizing ChatGPT's natural language processing capabilities, the 
    chatbot interprets user commands and executes corresponding actions with Google Calendar.

Usage:
Once the bot is running, users can interact with it by sending commands in the specified Discord channels. For example:
    - To add an event to Google Calendar, users can provide event details to the bot.
    - To retrieve upcoming events, users can request event information from the bot.


And the source code is not open on the Github right now because we want to develop and integrate more functionalities into ChatGPT.
