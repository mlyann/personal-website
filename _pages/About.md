I am a [Computer Science](https://www.cs.arizona.edu/) student at [the University of Arizona](https://www.arizona.edu/), holding a perfect 4.0 GPA and specializing in software development, probabilistic modeling, and machine learning. I am actively seeking internship opportunities for the summer months (May to August) of 2025. My expected graduation date is December 2025.

As a full-stack developer, I have extensive experience with AWS, Nginx, Docker, React, and Django. During my internship at [CoreTechs Consulting Inc.](https://www.coretechs.com/), I managed end-to-end website development, created intelligent bots, and deployed applications using advanced cloud services.

My machine learning expertise includes developing GPT-based models at [AI Core](https://aicore.arizona.edu/) the University of Arizona's [Data Science Institute](https://datascience.arizona.edu/) and[ Institute for Computation and Data-Enabled Insight](https://datainsight.arizona.edu/). Additionally, I have research projects at the [ML4AI LAB](https://ml4ai.github.io/) and [IVI LAB](https://ivilab.org/), developing probabilistic graphical models (Dynamic Bayesian Network) to predict human beliefs in search and rescue missions and computationally understand human-beings. Additionally, I contributed to the ToMCAT dataset, exploring team dynamics in urban search and rescue missions using brain scans, physiological signals, and behavioral responses.

Outside of my technical pursuits, I am a violin enthusiast and avid hiker, which I often share about on my [blog](/blog/).

If you believe I would be a good fit for your team, please feel free to contact me!
