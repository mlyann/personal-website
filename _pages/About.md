I am a [Computer Science](https://www.cs.arizona.edu/) student at [the University of Arizona](https://www.arizona.edu/), holding a perfect 4.0 GPA and specializing in software development, probabilistic modeling, and machine learning. I am on track to complete my bachelorâ€™s degree in two years, with an expected graduation date of December 2025.

**Industry Experience:**
As a full-stack web developer, I have extensive experience with AWS, Nginx, Docker, React, Django and Wordpress. During my internship at [CoreTechs Consulting Inc.](https://www.coretechs.com/), I managed end-to-end website development, created intelligent bots, and deployed applications using advanced web services

My work at [AI Core](https://aicore.arizona.edu/) focuses on developing custom GPTs and exploring cutting-edge techniques by combining LLMs with Computer Vision to create realistic AI Agents. Our team is pioneering a "text-to-texture" system that generates lifelike avatars and NPCs in real-time using physically based rendering.

I'm also the [Vice President and co-founder](https://uaaiclub.com/team/) of the [Artificial Intelligence Club](https://uaaiclub.com/) at the University of Arizona. I lead all our directors, organize workshops, and partner with top companies and startups. Our mission is to give all UofA students access to AI, enabling them to create GPT models, agentic workflows and collaborate on industry projects.

**ML Research Focus:**
In the academic sphere, my research centers on computationally understanding and predicting human behavior. I am involved in [ToMCAT projects](https://ml4ai.github.io/tomcat/) at the [ML4AI LAB](https://ml4ai.github.io/) and [IVI LAB](https://ivilab.org/), supervised by [Prof. Kobus Barnard](https://www2.cs.arizona.edu/~kobus/) and [Prof. Adarsh Pyarelal](https://adarsh.cc/). My focus is on developing Dynamic Bayesian Networks to predict human beliefs in search and rescue missions, model human behavior, and build decision-making AI agents. The goal of my work is to create AI that can understand and operate in complex, real-world environments.

Outside of my technical pursuits, I am a violin enthusiast and avid hiker, which I often share on my blog.
