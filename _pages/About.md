I am a [Computer Science](https://www.cs.arizona.edu/) student at [the University of Arizona](https://www.arizona.edu/), holding a perfect 4.0 GPA and specializing in software development, probabilistic modeling, and machine learning. My expected graduation date is December 2025. 

As a full-stack web developer, I have extensive experience with AWS, Nginx, Docker, React, Django and Wordpress. During my internship at [CoreTechs Consulting Inc.](https://www.coretechs.com/), I managed end-to-end website development, created intelligent bots, and deployed applications using advanced web services.

I'm also the [Vice President and co-founder](https://uaaiclub.com/team/) of the [Artificial Intelligence Club](https://uaaiclub.com/) at the University of Arizona. I lead our directors, organize workshops, and partner with top companies and startups. Our mission is to give all UofA students access to AI, enabling them to create GPT models and collaborate on corporate projects.

My machine learning expertise includes developing GPT-based models at the University of Arizona's [AI Core](https://aicore.arizona.edu/), [Institute for Computation and Data-Enabled Insight](https://datainsight.arizona.edu/), and [Data Science Institute](https://datascience.arizona.edu/). I also work on [research projects (ToMCAT)](https://ml4ai.github.io/tomcat/) at the [ML4AI LAB](https://ml4ai.github.io/) and [IVI LAB](https://ivilab.org/), under the supervision of [Prof. Kobus Barnard](https://www2.cs.arizona.edu/~kobus/) and [Prof. Adarsh Pyarelal](https://adarsh.cc/). My focus is on developing probabilistic graphical models, specifically Dynamic Bayesian Networks, to predict human beliefs in search and rescue missions and to computationally understand human behavior. Additionally, I have contributed to the [ToMCAT dataset](https://ml4ai.github.io/tomcat/), which examines team dynamics in urban search and rescue missions through brain scans, physiological signals, and behavioral responses.

Outside of my technical pursuits, I am a violin enthusiast and avid hiker, which I often share about on my blog.
