I am a [Computer Science](https://www.cs.arizona.edu/) student at [the University of Arizona](https://www.arizona.edu/), holding a perfect 4.0 GPA and specializing in software development, probabilistic modeling, and machine learning. My expected graduation date is December 2025. 

As a full-stack developer, I have extensive experience with AWS, Nginx, Docker, React, and Django. During my internship at [CoreTechs Consulting Inc.](https://www.coretechs.com/), I managed end-to-end website development, created intelligent bots, and deployed applications using advanced web services.

I'm also the Vice President and co-founder of the [Artificial Intelligence Club](https://uaaiclub.com/) at the University of Arizona. I lead our directors, organize workshops, and partner with top companies and startups. Our mission is to give all UofA students access to AI, enabling them to create GPT models and collaborate on corporate projects.

My machine learning expertise includes developing GPT-based models at [AI Core](https://aicore.arizona.edu/), the University of Arizona's [Data Science Institute](https://datascience.arizona.edu/) and[ Institute for Computation and Data-Enabled Insight](https://datainsight.arizona.edu/). Additionally, I have [research projects](https://ml4ai.github.io/tomcat/) at the [ML4AI LAB](https://ml4ai.github.io/) and [IVI LAB](https://ivilab.org/), developing probabilistic graphical models (Dynamic Bayesian Network) to predict human beliefs in search and rescue missions and computationally understand human-beings. Additionally, I contributed to the [ToMCAT](https://ml4ai.github.io/tomcat/) dataset, exploring team dynamics in urban search and rescue missions using brain scans, physiological signals, and behavioral responses.

Outside of my technical pursuits, I am a violin enthusiast and avid hiker, which I often share about on my blog.
