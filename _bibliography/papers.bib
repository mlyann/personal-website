  abstract={First, we develop an Adaptive Population Control (ACC) model that explains the skewed sex ratio at high and low levels of resource availability as a control measure by lamprey to maximize their growth rate. We find that the advantage of a variable sex ratio is greatest under extremely poor or extremely suitable environmental conditions. Next, to account for the male skewed populations of lamprey at high densities, we develop a modified logistic growth model that allows for variable carrying capacity for males and females. Differential Carrying Capacity (DCC) model accurately predicts the optimal sex ratio to achieve the maximal growth rate at various population densities. In line with ACC, we use Aquatic Nutritional Network (ANN), a niche width differential equation model is developed by integrating concepts from Lotka-Volterra equations. to study the dynamics of lamprey and their native prey/predator. We find that variable sex ratios allow time for regeneration of the native prey in Lamprey.},
