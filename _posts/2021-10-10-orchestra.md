I had the incredible honor of performing with a globally renowned violist, which was an exhilarating experience. 🥰

Maestro [Cao Peng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cao_Peng)'s African Dance performance from the audience brought tears to my eyes with its beauty and emotion. 😭

Meeting and taking photos with outstanding senior musicians and the city's top teachers filled me with pride and gratitude. 🥳

A big thank you to Nanmo, the orchestra, and all the teachers for making this possible. ✌️✌️😘😘
